Components - Combining html and logic into a single reusable component.

JSX - is a syntax extension for Javascript.

- It allows us to write markup that looks like HTML directly inside of ourJS.
  It's not "legal" JS on its own, so it must be transpiled.

each component gets its own file. Should be named the same as the component.
